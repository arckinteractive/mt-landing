== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the settings to adjust the plugin work after activation? =

You can find the link to the Settings Page in the Plugin menu. 

= After the plugin installation I haven't adjusted the settings. What is the default email address used for a contact via the form? =

The address specified during WordPress installation will be used by the Contact Form Pro plugin as the default one.

= How can I add Contact Form Pro to my website? =

You should put the shortcode [bestwebsoft_contact_form] into your page or post.

= I chose a user via the plugin settings and got this error: "Please enter a valid email address. Settings are not saved." =

This means that you made a syntax error.

= How to use some other language files with the Contact Form Pro? = 

Here is an example for the German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to switch the WP version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` you should type `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly admin panel will be in German.
2. Make sure that there are the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the plugin (in the languages folder which is in the root of the plugin).
3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for the Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should type `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in both files).
4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file (the necessary language file) with this program and for each line in English write translation in German.
5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.

= How to add the contact form not in English? =

1. Add a language in the block "Language settings for the field names in the form" on the plugin settings page.
2. Mark the check box (if it's not marked yet) in the block  "Change the names of the contact form fields and error messages", choose the necessary tab, click the twistie to expand the list of the fields  and fill in the fields. Choose the necessary tab in the block "Action after email is sent" as well and fill in the field. Save the changes.
3. You will see the shortcode under the tab with the necessary language. Please paste that shortcode to the page or post. 

= I'm not receiving messages from Contact Form Pro OR The plugin does not send an email - "Sorry, email message could not be delivered." =

Please follow the instructions below:
1. Please check the plugin settings '/wp-admin/admin.php?page=contact_form_pro.php' => 'What to use?' => change the lines from wp-mail to mail and vice versa.
2. Email messages can be marked as spam on the server. Please choose another email instead of the admin's one ('Use this email:' block) - for example, gmail or similar. If the message is sent, it means that email filtering is set on your server. Please contact your hosting provider. 
3. Perhaps email sending is not set. You should install an extra plugin called WP-mail-SMTP and configure it. Afterwards you should send a test email from this plugin and you will see if the plugin logs have errors.
Note: If the Contact Form sends letters, but you don't receive them, you can install our plugin Contact Form to DB in order not to lose the sent letters for the time the problem is being solved.
