Easy and secure credit card payments on your WordPress site with Stripe and Gravity Forms!

== Description ==

[Stripe](https://stripe.com) allows you to process credit cards directly on your site, securely and easily, without having to deal with merchant accounts, PCI-compliance, or PayPal. This Gravity Forms add-on integrates Stripe with your forms using [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js) to make sure sensitive card information never hits your server.

> This plugin is an add-on for the [Gravity Forms plugin](http://gravityforms.com "visit the Gravity Forms website").
> You need to [purchase your own Gravity Forms license](http://gravityforms.com "purchase Gravity Forms!") if you don't already have one - you'll thank me later :-)
>
> You'll also need a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account.

Requires WordPress 3.6, PHP 5.3, and Gravity Forms 1.8.1. Works with WordPress Multisite.

**Current Features**

* One-time payments
* International Stripe accounts, including those with multiple currencies
* Stripe + PayPal option on same form
* *Save credit cards instead of charging them right away

* *Multiple quantities of one subscription, e.g. 5 users at $10/month/user

**Support**

* Although I am unable to monitor the forums here or provide free support, **full, paid support is available at [gravity+](https://gravityplus.pro)**. I am very happy to help.
* Also, neither Gravity Forms nor Stripe provides support for this plugin.
* If you think you've found a bug or you're not sure if you need to purchase support, feel free to [contact me](https://gravityplus.pro/).

**Current Limitations**

* Cannot have Stripe Add-On "activated" at the same time as Authorize.Net or PayPal Pro Add-Ons
* For security reasons, credit card field has to be on the last page of a multi-page form
* One Stripe form per page

**Reported Conflicts**

* plugin: Shortcodes Ultimate
* plugin: PHP Shortcode Version 1.3
* theme: Themeforest themes that strip shortcodes
* plugin: Root Relative URLs

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install and setup the Gravity Forms Stripe Add-On. Be sure to follow *all* of the instructions in order for the Add-On to work properly.

1. Make sure that Gravity Forms is activated
2. Upload the `gravity-forms-stripe` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Add your Stripe API keys to the Stripe tab on the Settings page (Forms->Settings).
5. Create a form, adding at least one product field along with the new 'Credit Card' field that appears under 'Pricing Fields.' Keep in mind that Stripe accepts a minimum charge of $0.50 - this means that the total amount of your form must be at least $0.50.
6. Under Forms->Stripe, add a Stripe feed for your new form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have my own copy of Gravity Forms for this plugin to work? =
Yes, you need to install the [Gravity Forms Plugin](http://gravityforms.com "visit the Gravity Forms website") for this plugin to work.

= What is the minimum amount my form can accept? =
$0.50, [per Stripe](https://stripe.com/help/faq)

= Does this version work with the latest version of Gravity Forms? =
Just look at the version number! The versioning scheme now uses the Gravity Forms major release number. If the Add-On version number starts with a Gravity Forms major release number like *1.8*, then it will work with *Gravity Forms 1.8* and all of its minor releases Ñ 1.8.1, 1.8.2, etc.

= Does your plugin use Stripe.js? =
Yes.

= Do I need to have SSL? =
Yes, according to the Stripe Terms of Service regarding PCI-compliance.

= Why am I getting an 'Empty string given for card' error? =
Here are a few possible reasons, listed in the order they are most likely to occur:

1. Your theme (especially if purchased from Themeforest) is stripping the shortcode, preventing the Stripe JS from working. Here's what you want to look for in your theme files (the code is in yellow) and disable by placing a '//' without the quotes in front of those lines:
http://kaptinlin.com/support/discussion/7420/gravity-forms-code-of-the-raw-shortcode-discussion-thread/p1

This code may also be in a file called shortcodes.php or ThemeShortcodes.php.

2. Another theme or plugin is modifying the standard Gravity Forms dropdowns and removing the classes, which breaks the Stripe JS. You'll want to contact the theme author to learn how to prevent this.

3. You've embedded your Gravity Form directly into the page and missed one of the Gravity Forms instructions Ñ happens to the best of us! Here are the instructions: http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Embedding_A_Form

4. Another plugin is preventing the JS from working. Follow the procedure outlined here by Gravity Forms in order to troubleshoot: http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Testing_for_a_Theme/Plugin_Conflict with one minor change -- For plugin conflicts, deactivate all plugins except Gravity Forms and Gravity Forms + Stripe.

5. JavaScript is not available to browser

= Do I need to purchase +(More) Stripe to make this plugin work? =
No. If you are having an issue and tried the troubleshooting steps, [purchase support](https://gravityplus.pro/). +(More) Stripe will *not* fix your issue --
it only adds features.

= Your plugin just does not work =
I can assure you that is not the case -- [this should help you find where the problem is occurring](http://scribu.net/wordpress/wordpress-plugin-troubleshooting-flowchart.html) or [this](http://uproot.us/docs/how-to-troubleshoot-plugin-issues/)

= How do I know if I need to purchase support? =
You can [contact me](https://gravityplus.pro/)
